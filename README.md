## *Good Deeds Bot In Telegram*:
Written in Python using Poetry, MONGODB and GIT. The bot was made in teamwork as a part of a hackathon.
<br>During the "Iron Swords" war, people were looking for a way to ask for help and to find those who could help them. 
<br>Thus, the bot's purpose is to connect by location between those who want to volunteer to people who have help requests.
